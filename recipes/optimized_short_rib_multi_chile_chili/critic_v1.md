# Critique Report v1 — Baseline Recipe v1

target_baseline: baseline_v1.md

## Flavor Analysis (Score: 0.88)
- Strengths: Chile paste integration with umami stack mirrors vector `[4,5,3,6,9,7]`.
- Issue: Finish step aggregates cider vinegar, fresh chile, and hot sauce without quantified limits referencing ING-020 and ING-028, risking sour/heat drift.

## Technique Review (Score: 0.84)
- Strengths: Triple sear and paste fry produce Maillard depth.
- Issue: Bean hydration time noted but no simmer checkpoints to prevent bursting; Step 7 lacks temperature guidance.

## Cultural Integrity (Score: 0.92)
- Strengths: Honors dried chile trinity plus beans.
- Issue: Vodka/bourbon usage (ING-027) lacks explanation on how much spirit remains, potentially conflicting with traditional profiles.

## Mandatory Actions
1. Issue: Finish step lacks dosing ranges for vinegar and hot sauce (Section Procedure Step 8; ING-020, ING-028). Impact: Potential imbalance vs FlavorProfile sour/heat targets. Directive: Specify precise final-volume adjustments and tasting cadence.
2. Issue: Bean doneness control unspecified (Procedure Step 7; ING-002). Impact: Risk of uneven texture lowering texture goal compliance. Directive: Add simmer temperature or visual checkpoints with stirring cadence.
3. Issue: Deglazing spirit rationale absent (Procedure Step 5; ING-027). Impact: Cultural integrity questions. Directive: Document evaporation timeline or alternative if alcohol avoidance required.

## Optional Enhancements
1. Suggest providing resting period before serving to redistribute fat.
2. Note option for masa harina slurry if additional viscosity needed.
