# Dairy-Free Variant — Optimized Short Rib & Multi-Chile Chili

## Overview
- Ensures the chili remains dairy-free by verifying hidden derivatives and swapping any optional creamy garnishes while protecting texture and mouthfeel.

## Substitution Ledger
| Original | Substitute | Function | Match Level | Implementation Step |
|----------|------------|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Unsweetened chocolate | Certified dairy-free 85% cacao | Bitter Maillard booster | 0.90 | Step 6 |
| Optional crema garnish | Toasted cashew-lime crema | Cooling garnish | 0.82 | Service |

## Ingredients
- Follow baseline ingredient list with dairy-free chocolate substitution.
- Optional cashew-lime crema (if used): 120 g soaked cashews, 40 g lime juice, 80 g water, 4 g salt — blended.

## Procedure
1. EXECUTE Steps 1–6 from baseline ensuring dairy-free cacao is folded with umami stack.  
2. MAINTAIN covered simmer at 93°C for 120 minutes, stirring as instructed for beans.  
3. COMPLETE uncovered finish and calibrated vinegar/hot sauce dosing.  
4. BLEND cashew-lime crema until satin; serve separately so base chili remains dairy-free if garnish declined.

## Sensory Parity
- Creaminess upheld through natural collagen plus bean starch; cashew crema provides optional cooling fat.

## Allergen Statement
- Dairy Status: cleared. Cross-contact controls: dedicate chocolate knife, sanitize blender before crema, label service vessels to avoid dairy additions.
