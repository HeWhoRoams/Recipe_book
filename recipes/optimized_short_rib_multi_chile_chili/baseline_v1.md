## Mise en Place
- Soak kidney beans for 12 hours in lightly salted water; drain.
- Stem, seed (optional), and toast all dried chiles until aromatic; soak in 400 g hot water.
- Dice onions, mince garlic, and measure spices into separate ramekins.
- Cube short ribs into 4 cm pieces and pat dry.
- Pre-mix umami additives (tomato paste, soy, marmite, anchovy, chocolate, coffee) for faster incorporation.

## Cooking Procedure
1. TOAST dried chiles, cumin, coriander, cloves, and star anise in a dry Dutch oven over medium heat for 3 minutes, stirring to prevent scorching.
2. BLEND soaked chiles with their liquid, toasted spices, half the onions, garlic, and umami additives until silky; reserve chile paste.
3. SEAR short rib cubes in vegetable oil over high heat in batches, browning all sides for 3 minutes per side; transfer to a tray and reserve fond.
4. SWEAT remaining onions and garlic in rendered fat for 6 minutes, scraping fond, then add chile paste to fry until it darkens and thickens, about 5 minutes.
5. DEGLAZE with vodka or bourbon, reducing by half, then stir in tomato paste, brown sugar, soy sauce, marmite, anchovies, coffee, and chocolate until dissolved.
6. COMBINE seared beef, drained beans, crushed tomatoes, chicken broth, bay leaves, and Mexican oregano; bring to a simmer while skimming foam.
7. BRAISE covered at gentle simmer for 2 hours, stirring every 20 minutes to prevent sticking and maintain even bean cooking.
8. FINISH uncovered for 30 minutes to thicken, adjusting seasoning with kosher salt, cider vinegar, minced fresh chiles, and controlled hot sauce additions to hit flavor vector.
