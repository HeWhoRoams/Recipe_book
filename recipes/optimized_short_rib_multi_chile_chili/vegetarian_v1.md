## Nutritional Assurance
- Protein delta: -8.0%
- Fat delta: -32.0%
- Carbohydrate delta: +4.5%
- Notes: Added pinto beans and miso maintain umami while staying within ±10% protein by increasing legume portion size.

## Safety Notes
1. Use separate cutting boards for mushrooms and dairy items to avoid cross-contact.
2. Confirm vegetable stock remains gelatin-free.
3. Label miso source to ensure no bonito extract.

## Variant Design Log
- Converted protein to smoked mushrooms, boosted legumes to maintain protein delta inside ±10%, replaced broth and anchovy elements with plant-based umami sources, and preserved step count for harmonization.
