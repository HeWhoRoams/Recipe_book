# Baseline Recipe v2 — Optimized Short Rib & Multi-Chile Chili

## Dish Overview
- Triple-seared short ribs simmer with calibrated multi-chile paste while quantified finishing acids maintain Flavor Profile vector `[4,5,3,6,9,7]`.
- Serves 8; bean tenderness safeguarded through staged simmer checks.

## Mise in Place
- Soak kidney beans for 12 hours in 1% salt solution; drain and hold refrigerated until cook time.
- Toast dried chiles and spices, then soak chiles in 400 g 90°C water for 15 minutes.
- Dice onions, mince garlic, and weigh finishing acids separately (two ramekins for vinegar and hot sauce) for precise dosing.
- Cube and dry short ribs; keep chilled to maintain sear quality.
- Pre-scale umami stack (tomato paste, soy, marmite, anchovy, chocolate, coffee) for immediate blending.

## Procedure
1. TOAST dried chiles plus cumin, coriander, cloves, and star anise in a Dutch oven over medium heat for 3 minutes until aromatic; remove and cool.  
2. BLEND soaked chiles with soaking liquor (reserve 300 g), half the onions, garlic, and umami stack into a smooth paste registering ≥65°C to sanitize.  
3. SEAR short rib cubes in vegetable oil at 205°C surface temperature for 3 minutes per side, working in four batches; transfer meat and reserve rendered fat.  
4. SWEAT remaining onions and garlic over medium heat for 6 minutes, then STIR IN chile paste to fry for 5 minutes until it thickens and the oil turns brick red.  
5. DEGLAZE with vodka or bourbon, reducing for exactly 90 seconds to boil off alcohol; note optional swap to charred apple cider for alcohol-free service.  
6. FOLD in tomato paste, brown sugar, soy sauce, marmite, anchovies, coffee, chocolate, Mexican oregano, and bay leaves until dissolved.  
7. COMBINE seared beef, drained beans, crushed tomatoes, chicken broth, and reserved chile liquor; bring to a gentle simmer (93°C) and cook covered for 120 minutes, stirring every 20 minutes and checking bean creaminess at 60 and 90 minutes.  
8. FINISH uncovered for 30 minutes to reach spoon-coating viscosity, then add kosher salt to taste plus precise finishing acids: 15 g cider vinegar followed by 5 g increments until sour score matches 5, and 10 g hot sauce followed by 2 g increments until heat score matches 7, tasting between additions.  

## Timing Chart
| Phase | Duration (min) |
|-------|----------------|
| Prep and soaking | 30 |
| Chile paste production | 20 |
| Triple sear | 25 |
| Aromatic fry and deglaze | 15 |
| Covered simmer | 120 |
| Uncovered finish | 30 |
| Total | 240 |

## Plating Notes
- Serve in pre-warmed wide bowls with a shallow ladleful ensuring each portion contains shredded beef, beans, and glossy gravy.
- Garnish with minced fresh chile, a drizzle of reserved chile oil, and optional pickled onions while keeping toppings restrained to maintain cultural integrity.

## Compliance Log
- Directive 1 (Finishing acid/heat ranges) — satisfied via quantified Step 8 dosing.
- Directive 2 (Bean texture controls) — satisfied via Step 7 temperature and checkpoints.
- Directive 3 (Deglazing spirit rationale) — satisfied via Step 5 evaporation timing and non-alcohol alternative.

Notes: Calculations used `living_kitchen/global_memory/global_macro_reference.json` per-gram values. Assumptions: dried kidney beans converted to cooked weight using a 2.6x expansion factor; `soy_sauce` approximated with `marmite` macros; `kosher_salt` (18 g total) was converted to sodium using NaCl = 39.3% sodium by weight and included in the sodium total. Values rounded to three significant figures.
