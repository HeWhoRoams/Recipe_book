# Dairy-Free Variant v1 — Optimized Short Rib & Multi-Chile Chili

version: 1
timestamp: T0
source_recipe: baseline_v2.md

## Overview
- Ensures the chili remains dairy-free by verifying hidden derivatives and swapping any optional creamy garnishes while protecting texture and mouthfeel.

## Substitution Ledger
| Original | Substitute | Function | Match Level | Implementation Step |
|----------|------------|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Unsweetened chocolate (ING-012) | Certified dairy-free 85% cacao | Bitter Maillard booster | 0.90 | Step 6 |
| Optional crema garnish (non-specified) | Toasted cashew-lime crema | Cooling garnish | 0.82 | Service |

## Ingredients
- Follow baseline_v2 ingredient table with the chocolate change above.
- Optional cashew-lime crema: 120 g soaked cashews, 40 g lime juice, 80 g water, 4 g salt (blended).

## Procedure
1. EXECUTE Steps 1–6 from baseline_v2 ensuring dairy-free cacao is folded with umami stack.
2. MAINTAIN covered simmer at 93°C for 120 minutes, stirring as instructed for beans.
3. COMPLETE uncovered finish and calibrated vinegar/hot sauce dosing.
4. BLEND cashew-lime crema until satin; serve separately so base chili remains dairy-free if garnish declined.

## Sensory Parity
- Creaminess upheld through natural collagen plus bean starch; cashew crema provides optional cooling fat.
- Body and aroma match baseline due to unchanged cooking medium and chile ratios.

## Allergen Statement
- Dairy Status: cleared. Cross-contact controls: dedicate chocolate knife, sanitize blender before crema, label service vessels to avoid dairy additions.

## Variant Design Log
- Audited all ingredients for hidden dairy risk, swapped chocolate and garnishes for plant-based alternatives, and added optional cashew crema to protect mouthfeel without violating dairy-free status.
