## Technique Workflow
1. CURE Wagyu ribs with 1.5% salt for 12 hours, vacuum seal with toasted spices, and sous-vide at 62°C / 144°F for 36 hours; shock in ice bath, reserve jus.
2. BUILD chile paste by stone-grinding toasted dried chiles with demi glacé, aged soy, marmite, anchovy oil, espresso, and chocolate until satin.
3. INFUSE marrow-chicken demi with chile paste, smoked tomatoes, and bean purée; simmer at 90°C / 194°F for 45 minutes, strain twice for silkiness.
4. GLAZE rib portions in copper pans, basting with reduced chile consomme until lacquered (internal 63°C / 145°F).
5. FINISH sauce with pipetted cider vinegar micro-doses (0.5 ml increments) and table-side smoked pequin oil.
