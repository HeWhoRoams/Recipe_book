# Weeknight Variant Log

- Mode: Substitution (pressure-cook + canned beans to meet time target)
- Compliance: PASS (maintains flavor vector and required umami stack)
- Substitutions:
  - `short_ribs (2.3 kg) -> boneless short ribs (1.1 kg)` for faster sear and pressure-cook compatibility.
  - `dried beans -> canned, rinsed (425 g)` to reduce soak/cook time.
- Notes: Macro adjustments scaled to 4 servings.
