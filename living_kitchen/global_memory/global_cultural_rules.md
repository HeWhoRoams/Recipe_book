version: 1

update_delta_bounds: ±0.05 max per run

## Core Principles
1. Respect originating cuisine staples before introducing fusion techniques; document justification for any deviation.
2. Cite source feedback (human or audit) when adding/changing rules.
3. Hard “no” rules override automated substitutions.
